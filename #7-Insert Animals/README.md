"Sure being a coder is fun and all, but you know whatâ€™s better? Being a coder at a zoo. Using MongoDB, you're going to make a zoo database."

Instructions
Startup mongod and the mongo shell and switch to a new db named zoo.

Insert into a collection named animals: One entry for each of your five favorite animals.

Each entry should have

A field of numlegs with an integer of the number of legs that animal has.
A field of class with that animal's class (mammal, reptile, etc).
A field of weight with an integer of the weight of the animal in pounds (any reasonable weight, really).
A field of name, with the animal's name.
A field of whatIWouldReallyCallIt with the name of what you would call the animal if you got to name it.
Example:

{ "name": "Panda", "numlegs": 4, "class": "mammal", "weight": 254, "whatIWouldReallyCallIt": "Desiigner" }
